How is everyone doing today? Are you guys having a good time here at the Bitcoin 2013 conference? 

It was about a year and a half ago that I was at the first-ever Bitcoin conference in New York City and there were only about 60 or 70 people there but the number of friendships and businesses and projects that came out of that meeting led to a tremendous number of great things that we have today so I can't imagine what this conference, with over a thousand people, is going to yield in a year or two years. It's gonna be very exciting. 

My name is Erik Voorhees. Some of you know me as evoorhees on the forums and on Reddit. I discovered Bitcoin in May of 2011, just before the first bubble. And through 2012, I was the head of marketing and communications for BitInstant, which was one of the largest Bitcoin companies in the world based out of New York City. And a couple months ago, I left BitInstant to be the CEO of Coinapult which is now based down in Panama. Coinapult allows people to send bitcoin to email and SMS through your phone and some of you may know that I'm involved in a little project called Satoshi Dice, which is the world's largest and most popular Bitcoin game. It is responsible for roughly half of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever occurred and more than half of all the mining fees that have ever been paid—but this talk is about how we get around the 21 million bitcoin limit. I started to think that it's a very silly rule and that we actually need a monetary supply that can grow with the economy... I'm just kidding. It's actually about the role of bitcoin as money and it's intended to give people a better understanding of money itself because to really understand bitcoin, you have to understand money from a very fundamental point of view. 

So for this talk, you can forget the tech, you can forget the mining, you can forget all the cryptography, and the peer-to-peer networks, and the open-source code—and you can forget these things because I don't understand them either. But more importantly, all these things are really secondary to an understanding of money itself. The core of the Bitcoin experiment is not about tech, it is about money. 

So unfortunately, most people do not spend enough time pondering the nature of money and this is strange and somewhat tragic because we spend our lives chasing it. Money is half of every transaction. It is the most important commodity in the world and yet, for the most part, people have only the most superficial understanding of it. And from an early age, we understand that money is good, right? We want it. We're happy when we have it and we're sad when we don't. And we learned that to obtain money, we must work hard; and as we leave childhood, we go to school for many years and work very hard so that we may obtain more money. So much of our lives is spent searching and grasping for something that we don't really understand. Now on the surface, the reason that we seek this money is very simple, right? It lets us buy things–the utility of a new car or the entertainment value of an Xbox or the delicious flavor of a nice steak dinner. All these things are apparent to us and if we want those things we have to get money in order to buy them. But what we don't spend enough time considering is why the money we use actually enables us to obtain the car the Xbox and the dinner. Why is a shoemaker willing to give us his shoes in return for our money and you cannot answer this by saying that the shoemaker will in turn hand his money over to someone else because this begs the question, why does that person want the money? And if nobody actually wants the money and they only care about what the money can buy, how did this whole crazy system get started? Who was the first person tricked into accepting something so silly as money in return for something real? So this is what we want to examine; we want to see how we got to this point. 

Now in school, we learned that before we had money we had something called a barter system. Caveman number one would trade his fresh mammoth meat for a nice new spear from caveman-2 and bartering this way makes intuitive sense to us and even as children we engage in it. School then tells us that there is something wrong with bartering, something called a coincidence of wants. For if caveman-1 wants the spear from caveman-2, then that's fine, but what if he doesn't want a spear? In a barter system, few trades are able to occur because of this dilemma and the extent of the market is severely limited—and again this makes intuitive sense. So we learned that to get around the coincidence of wants dilemma, money was invented and money is simply the name for a common medium of exchange whereby everyone agrees to trade money instead of other objects. And we learned that things like wampum shells were early forms of money and that eventually, people began to use gold and silver. And now today we've used fiat paper bills as our form of money and since this narrative is presented to us as one of ongoing human development, most children tend to grow up assuming that dollars or euros or yen are proper money and things like seashells and gold are outdated relics; further, they come to perceive dollars as a very physical item because they can hold physical bills in their wallet. And we all see movies with the bad guys robbing the bank and stealing big piles of cash and we all want that pile of cash. So even though nearly all of our dollars are digital today, we still perceive them as something very physical. And with this as our frame of reference, bitcoin looks kind of absurd, doesn't it? If one compares dollars to bitcoin, bitcoin looks like a joke. It's purely digital, It's not backed by any trusted government, unregulated, no presidential heads or Latin incantations inscribed upon it—clearly, it is nothing more than magic Internet money—an absurd fad, a bubble, tulip mania, pets.com, Ponzi scheme. But why is it that some people believe in bitcoin as money when it is so clearly different to dollars which are clearly the best form of money that we could ever hope to have. And I think it's because these people have a different understanding of money itself and this different understanding is not really taught to us in school. Consider that a crucial question may have been missed: Why were seashells or gold chosen as money in the first place? Was there a vote? Do people just wake up and start using it? Do people switch over one morning as they do with daylight savings time? I believe that the question of why gold became money is in fact one of the most egregious lapses in modern education. 

Gold was the money of the world all the way up until 1971. Why was this the case? Why was it gold and not rubies or eggs or feathers? And if gold was chosen as money and no one ever seems to have enough money, then why wasn't something more plentiful like grass chosen as money? Clearly, if grass had been chosen as money we would all have plenty of it and poverty would have been wiped out thousands of years ago. So whose bright idea was it to choose gold? In an absence of a proper education, most people assume that society just arbitrarily decided to make gold money and that any other commodity would have worked roughly as well. They perceived money as an arbitrary token; but this is a mistake and this is where the grand misunderstanding of bitcoin begins because if money is an arbitrary token and we already have an arbitrary token backed by The Full Faith and Credit of the United States government, why should we get distracted by some other arbitrary token? And the reason is that money is not arbitrary. Money is selected with very good reason and through a very natural process. Now gold became money gradually over time, not by mistake but because it had specific attributes that made it highly useful in exchange. It is these attributes, these specific properties of gold which led it to be used increasingly as a medium of exchange. Simply put, gold has better properties than anything else. So what are these properties of gold?  Gold is scarce. This is important because if something like grass was our medium of exchange, how many wheelbarrows full of grass would you need to take to the store in order to buy your food? Gold is fungible and uniform; every ounce of gold is the same as every other. This is why things like rubies or diamonds, while they could work as money, aren't as ideal as gold. Gold is transportable, it has a high value to weight ratio, it's easily identifiable and it is highly durable; it will not rot when you try to save it. And the supply of gold is relatively steady and predictable. And so if you understand that these attributes make gold a great means of exchange, you'll understand why gold was increasingly sought in the marketplace. And what this means is that a money-based system is not actually something separate from a barter system at all. It's simply a barter system that has been running for a while, a barter system that has coalesced around one or several key goods. 

We're actually still in a barter system and most people today prefer to barter for goods called gold or dollars or bitcoin. We call these most exchangeable of goods money. So money is thus nothing more than the outcome of barter and historically this has tended to be gold simply because it had the best attributes for use in exchange and so if we understand this and we see the genesis of Gold's monetary use—that it was nothing magical or arbitrary… gold simply had the best properties for exchange and was thus frequently bartered for. Then it should not be a stretch to imagine that a commodity with even better properties than gold might make an even better money. And this is what I found when I discovered bitcoin. “Now but wait, Eric,” some of you might say this. We already have something better than gold it's called the United States Federal Reserve Note, also known as the dollar. Certainly, the Federal Reserve note is superior to gold and that's why we use it today. Well, let's examine the properties of this form of money. 

Dollars are fungible and uniform, and that's good. They are transportable, perhaps even more easily than gold. They have a high value-to-weight ratio. They're fairly easy to divide and recombine—so this looks pretty good so far but what else? Well, they've lost 98% of their value since the Federal Reserve created them. Why is that? Well, it's because they are constantly created out of thin air. Every year vast quantities of dollars are produced; this is called inflation. And while most people assume that inflation is just a natural phenomenon like rain or sunshine, that's incorrect, it's just money being created and debased constantly. And in fact, it may be the greatest scam ever devised. But a scam needs a victim. Why would anyone choose to accept a form of money that could be constantly created out of thin air and which loses purchasing power with every passing day? The reason is that they're forced to. They're forced to pay tribute to the government using this money through a scheme called taxation and through legal tender laws; in other words, dollars are not used over gold because the attributes of the dollars are superior. A free market did not choose dollars because of the merit of the dollars. Dollars are used because people are forced to use them. And we could discuss why the government forces people to use dollars or the various ways in which it does this, but those are topics for a different discussion. So these are the concepts behind money that people need to understand. Gold’s value is due to its specific attributes while the dollar’s value is due to legal force. So how does this relate to bitcoin? Bitcoin’s value as money needs to be understood like gold which comes not from legal force but from its specific attributes. 

Bitcoin’s attributes make it an amazing form of money and it was engineered just for that purpose. So what are these attributes? bitcoin is easy to divide and recombine, incredibly easy in fact, you can divide it into 100 million pieces and recombine it on your phone. Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited unlike dollars and to some degree unlike gold, which is occasionally filled with tungsten. Bitcoin is highly durable; so long as certain precautions are taken, the coins will not just disappear or decay over time. And perhaps most important, bitcoin can be sent anywhere instantly at near-zero costs. Now if you were to create a superhero currency this is an attribute that you would give it. It is essentially the ability to fly. Now you can't do this with gold due to physical constraints and you can't do this with dollars due to legal constraints. Further, bitcoin is scarce. It has a known supply and a very fixed inflation schedule that everyone understands. Bitcoin cannot be manipulated, restricted, or seized by any central party. It shares this property with gold. Nobody has special privileges, in this way it is very democratic and egalitarian. And just as mankind has engineered houses to be used as shelter and cars to be used as transportation so too can we engineer something to be used as an ideal medium of exchange. But while the dollar is a very poorly engineered money, so poorly in fact that it requires coercion for its value, bitcoin is a brilliantly engineered money. It might not be perfect but bitcoin is pretty damn good and this is why people are using it as money despite the fact that nobody is forced to. And given that it is so useful as money due to its attributes, it should not be a surprise to anyone that it commands a market price. Any good that is useful and scarce will have a price. Economists and journalists often get caught up in this question, “Why does bitcoin have value?” And the answer is very easy: because it is useful and scarce. I think these people should be asking the more important question, why do they have value? And the corollary here is that bitcoin’s value can never reach zero unless it is no longer useful or no longer scarce. So this brings us to the more interesting topic, for if bitcoin is so well-engineered as money, won't it necessarily begin competing with other forms of money? A fair question would be, “well if that were true, Eric, why have people not tended toward gold over the dollar? Isn't gold as you claim a superior form of money?” The reason is that while gold works very well as a store value, indeed the best that the world has ever known, it doesn't work so well as a means of exchange in our modern society and this should be obvious. 

Transacting in physical gold is unfortunately quite a burden; and while services like E-Gold had huge potential, they inevitably fail because as soon as they become successful the government shuts them down. To those of you who don't know, E-Gold was a company several years ago that allowed you to have a digital currency that was backed by gold held by the E-Gold company. And this was brilliant and it worked very nicely until they got too big and they were shut down. If a digital gold company becomes too successful the government will simply destroy it. And this is why gold remains safely in vaults; it is used for storing wealth but not used so well as a currency. So we see that physical bullion is too inconvenient and a digital bullion currency is a fantasy because it requires backing by a party that can be shut down. This is also why anyone who suggests that bitcoin should be backed by a real asset such as gold is gravely misunderstanding the situation. Backing injects counter-party risk because a specific person or entity must be obligated to fulfill the backing. Backing requires a backer. Bitcoin does not need backing because it is a digital commodity that is valuable itself, and valuable in large part because it carries no physical burdens or constraints. It is this lack of physical backing which enables it to move anywhere instantly at near-zero cost. So one can see the bitcoin is revolutionary in this regard. For the first time ever, a form of money superior to all others due to its specific attributes has been successfully decentralized and decoupled from the material world in such a way that nobody can turn the system off. The world has never seen this before. 

I think that there's now a certain inevitability that markets around the world will gradually gravitate toward the superior money; after all, money is a good like all others and it competes for the attention of those using it. So I think it is fair to say that Bitcoin is a monumental invention that has finally been captured by mankind. And if you understand the deep and central role that money plays in every aspect of our lives then might not Bitcoin be considered as important as things like the printing press or the automobile or the internet? And considering these other inventions, not everybody is literate, not everybody has a car and not everybody is online—but everybody uses money. And for those who are wondering, you do not even need the internet to use Bitcoin. So all of you who are involved in this right now are making history. And perhaps most exciting about this, is that the only thing which can derail this invention is an even better invention if you play through the various scenarios in your mind you'll realize that bitcoin can only fail if they superior currency takes its place, in which case mankind is even better off and the promise of Bitcoin will carry forward into its successor. So the genie is truly out of the bottle and we're right now in the middle of a very grand experiment to see what this genie is capable of. The point is this: bitcoin, like gold, has properties that make it an excellent form of money; however, unlike gold, bitcoin can actually be used in our modern economy for day-to-day exchange. Unlike gold, bitcoin as an asset with no counterparty risk can be transferred to anyone on the planet in one second. It is superhero currency and nobody's permission is needed. There is no Terms of Service. Further, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means that is not in danger of being shut off. The incumbent monetary monopolist cannot stop it. Perhaps you know to who I’m referring? Thus bitcoin can actually achieve critical mass. And nothing has ever been able to claim these attributes before. And this is why it is very foolish to compare bitcoin to any other digital currency—from Facebook credits to World of Warcraft gold to everyone's favorite virtual currency, the United States dollar. Bitcoin’s attributes enable it to operate freely and grow with an increasingly larger sphere of activity. Inevitably, this means it will start displacing monies with inferior attributes. Bitcoin will grow like a benevolent Hydra with heads sprouting up in every country, in every community; it will gobble up commerce that has until now been shackled to the economic witchcraft of a decrepit fiat financial system and it will leave an expansive frictionless marketplace in its wake. It is up to all of you guys to grow and capture and nurture that new marketplace. 

Someday in school, I think that the curriculum will be different. The children will be taught the true nature of money. They'll learn the difference between a real asset like bitcoin which is based on merit and a virtual currency like the US dollar which is based on coercion. They’ll learn how powerful the market can be when its medium of exchange is honest and they’ll learn how a small group of idealistic entrepreneurs saved the world from a monetary Dark Age. I feel very excited for my children to someday grow up in this world and I am deeply honored to be here with all of you in San Jose working on this project and I can't wait to see what happens. 

Thank you very much.
